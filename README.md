# README

This repository or distribution features the document named
**Muldis Object Notation** (**MUON**)
and its supporting documents.

This is the feature document, the actual formal **Muldis Object Notation**
specification, which is composed of multiple parts plus supporting files:

- [spec/Muldis_Object_Notation.md](spec/Muldis_Object_Notation.md)

This document has quick reference code examples copied from the formal spec:

- [spec/MUON_Syntax_Parallels.md](spec/MUON_Syntax_Parallels.md)

These documents have supplemental material that used to be part of the
formal spec but was since removed from it, typically to simplify or reduce
the scope of the formal spec, and are preserved here for posterity or
because they might be useful for tangential projects:

- [spec/MUON_Hosted_Syntaxes_Supplemental.md](spec/MUON_Hosted_Syntaxes_Supplemental.md)
- [spec/MUON_Syntax_Plain_Text_Supplemental.md](spec/MUON_Syntax_Plain_Text_Supplemental.md)

This tree of supporting files provides basic tooling related to the spec:

- [tooling/BBEdit/README.md](tooling/BBEdit/README.md)

This supplemental document compares **MUON** to other projects in its space:

- [spec/MUON_Feature_Comparison.md](spec/MUON_Feature_Comparison.md)
